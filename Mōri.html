            IS AT WAR...</b>
        </p>
        <p class = "SubsectionClass">You are Mōri Katsuko, a samurai who has been called by his 
            daimyo to aid the Ikko Ikki clan at their capital city. Sent with a
            supply wagon and only a handful of samurai, you must reach your ally's
            capital with the supplies, lest the Oda clan succeeds in their siege
            and brings another province under their control.<br><br></u>
            <i>Mōri</i> is a first-person combat game set within the Sengoku period of
            Japanese history. This is a title that takes inspiration from a variety of
            combat games, such as <i>Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, Ghost of Tsushima,
            Mordhau, Ninja: Gaiden,</i> and <i>Ultrakill</i>.<br><br>
            <i>Mōri</i> will include two game modes. The first mode will be a campaign,
            which will involve you entering the besieged capital and saving your allies.
            The second mode, however, will involve a "Horde" mode, wherein you will attempt
            to survive an onslaught of enemy forces, which will grow in size and difficulty
            as time progresses.<br><br>
            <b>Will you be the one prevail against the Oda clan's army, or will you bring shame
            to your clan and dishonor to your family?</b>
        </p>
