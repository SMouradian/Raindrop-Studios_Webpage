        <p class = "AU-TeamMembers", style = "text-indent: 50px;">Hello, my name is Simeon,
            and I am a fourth-year CSE student at the <u>University of Nevada, Reno</u>. My
            main focus regarding <i>Mōri’s</i> development has been the implementation of the
            <b>combat system</b> and the <b>animations</b> associated with it. My gaming journey
            started with a rip of <i>Call of Duty (2003)</i> that my dad had on our family computer
            and evolved to include various other genres over the years, from MOBAs like <i>League of
            Legends</i> to survival games like <i>Subnautica</i>. My recent rotation includes <i>Lies
            of P</i> and <i>Elden Ring</i>, which heavily inspire me to create robust and satisfying
            combat mechanics. Outside of the virtual world, I spend my time rock climbing and going to
            as many live shows as my wallet allows. This is the first game I have had the privilege to
            work on, and I am excited to see where this project goes!

        <p class = "AU-TeamMembers", style = "text-indent: 50px;">Heyo, everybody! My name Sam, and I
            am one of the developers working on <i>Mōri</i>. I am a senior at the <u>University of Nevada,
            Reno</u> and am currently pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering, as well as
            a minor in Journalism and Mathematics. I plan to use my credentials for video game journalism
            and video game development, but I would also like to prusue web development. The reason I wanted
            to make <i>Mōri</i> with Aidan, Arvind, and Simeon is because I have always been fascinated with
            video games. Working with my colleagues has allowed me to get hands on experience with basic game
            development using the Unity engine. As one of <i>Mōri's</i> developers, I am responsible for the
            <b>map and scene designs</b>, as well as the <b>player mechanics</b> our users will be introcuded to.
